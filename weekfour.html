        <h3><u>"As We May Think" By Vannevar Bush, 1945</u></h3>
        <p1>Vannevar Bush's 1945 piece talked about his idea of the "Memex". Initially coming across this idea, I was a little confused;
            However, as i went on reading, I found it to be interesting how Bush basically predicted the technology that we have today. 
            One of my favorite aspects of the piece was his ability to integrate ideas from different disciplines and still be able to 
            return back to his central idea. For example, he mentioned Mendel and his ideas: <br>
        "Mendel's concept of the laws of genetics was lost to the world for a generation because his publication did not reach the few 
        who were capable of grasping and extending it; and this sort of catastrophe is undoubtedly being repeated all about us, as truly
         significant attainments become lost in the mass of the inconsequential." <br> 
        I loved this comment as it helped to get Bush's point across and explain how we do so much research and we somehow still neglect 
        monumental ideas (exactly what happened to Mendel at the time). <br>
        Furthermore, Bush's attempt to further this idea by comparing it to the inforrmation assessment done by the Human Brain is one of
        my favorite additions. Being a person who doesn't always grasp the technological aspect of things, this inclusionhelped to ground
        the idea in my head in a way that I was able to comprehend.</p1>
