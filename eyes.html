    <div class="g">
    <p1> Aside from the things I see in my surroundings such as tall skyscrapers and busy streets, my eyes tend to 
        connect to nature a lot more than I could imagine. I greatly enjoy taking hikes with my friends and family. 
        Seeing the brightly colored leaves on trees as I walk through a quiet forest is the life I wish I could live everyday.
         Being able to see the beautiful scenery when you get to the top of your hike, it's an everlasting feeling.
         Even when it isnâ€™t that drastic, a walk through my neighborhood is enough to make me happy.
