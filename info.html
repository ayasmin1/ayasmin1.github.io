            <h1>Importance of Mental Health</h1>
            <p>Mental health is extremely important, as it can be the underlying factor that alot of us miss when we come across
                hardhsips in our lives. Although it's been talked about in the past, the importance of mental heealth is greatly stressed
                now, as researchers and psychologists have shown compelliing evidence that says that the United States is undergoing a mental
                health crisis. We ehave to rememberr that although our physical selves are important, if our mental health isn't accounted for,
                we can end up in a very bad place in life. Exposure to mental heatlh issues can help us to adknowledge the sensitivity of the issue,
                along with bringing awareness to it.
