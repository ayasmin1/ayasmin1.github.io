            <h1>Importance of Mental Health</h1>
            <p>Mental health is extremely important, as it can be the underlying factor that alot of us miss when we come across
                hardhsips in our lives. Although it's been talked about in the past, the importance of mental heealth is greatly stressed
                now, as researchers and psychologists have shown compelliing evidence that says that the United States is undergoing a mental
                health crisis. We have to rememberr that although our physical selves are important, if our mental health isn't accounted for,
                we can end up in a very bad place in life. Exposure to mental heatlh issues can help us to adknowledge the sensitivity of the issue,
                along with bringing awareness to it.

            <h1>Why is it important to practice good self-care habits at a younger age?</h1>
            <p>Majoirty of the mental health disorders that individuals get diagnosed with start around the age of 20; interestingly enough,
                around this age, most adults are still in college. College is in the top 5 answers to why many adults are facing mental health
                struggles; most colleges don't prioritize the prioroty of their students (aside from the generic information that is put out).
                Knowing this, it's important to prioritize self-care, as it'll help easee the amount of stress that you're likely to undergo.
