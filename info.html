            <h1>Importance of Mental Health</h1>
            <!----https://www.mentalhealth.gov/basics/what-is-mental-health---->
            <p>Mental health is extremely important, as it can be the underlying factor that many of us miss when facing
              hardships in our lives. Although it's been discussed in the past, the importance of mental health is much stressed
              now, as researchers and psychologists have shown compelling evidence that the United States is undergoing a mental
              health crisis. We have to remember that although our physical selves are important, if our mental health isn't accounted for,
              we can end up in a horrible place in life. Exposure to mental health issues can help us acknowledge the sensitivity of the case and bring awareness to it.

            <h1>Why is it important to practice good self-care habits at a younger age?</h1>
            <p>The majority of the mental health disorders that individuals get diagnosed with start around the age of 20; interestingly enough,
              most adults are still in college around this age. College is in the top 5 answers to why many adults face mental health
              struggles; most colleges don't prioritize their students (aside from the generic information that is put out).
              Knowing this, it's important to prioritize self-care, as it'll help ease the amount of stress you're likely to undergo.
