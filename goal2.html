            <h1>Becoming a Clinical Psychologist</h1>
            <p>I want to pursue a degree in psychology, specifically a Doctorate of Psychology (PSYD). I've had a passion in helping others eever since I was a child.
                I have always wanted to become a doctor but recently changed my mind and went in this direction for a few reasons. To start off, being a south asian female in the field of psychology
            is very rare and I want to become a role model to those who are also trying to pursue someething in this field. Representation is key and this would be a great start to something great.</p>

            <h1>Further Opportunities</h1>
            <p>With my PSYD, I want to open a mental health clinic for underrepresented communities in New York. Mental Health is often forgotten about in poorer communities because not many resources are available.
                I want to be able to give back and heelp those who might need the extra help. I woould reach out mostly to individuals in the Bronx, as their mental health rates are unfortunately the lowest in the state.
