    <h1><u>Madonna Inn: Why it's ✨Awesome✨</u></h1>
    <br>
    <div class="h"></div>
        <p>After looking through the Madonna Inn website, one of the rooms caught our eye and showed the true beauty of this hotel...</p>
    </div>
    <h2>
        <ul><a href="https://www.madonnainn.com/room-151-sugar-n-spiceRoom" target="_blank">151: Sugar & Spice</ul></a></h2>

    <div class="r">
        <p5>When you first see room 151, your eyes are met by tones of pink and brown with gold accents. This room looks nothing like what a regular hotel room would look like: the brown suede couch adds a bit of contrast to the lit up room. Furthermore,
            the chandelier gives the room an <i>elegant</i> touch. There are pieces of art and candles put all around the room, helping to bring it all together. One that's quite noteworthy is the gold candle holder: it adds a romatic vibe to the room
            without overdoing it.</p5>

        <p6>When I first saw the bathroom, I was a bit stunned. The pastel colors were almost the opposite of what was in the main room. However, it actually brings the entire room together. I think my favorite addition to ALL of the Madonna Inn rooms are
            thee rectangular mirrors with their floral decorations and lights. Being somebody who takes pictures of themsleves everywhere they go, this setup makes the bathrroom look elegant and classy, everything you need for a perfect picture.</p6>
