                <p2>Being able to use my sense of touch to feel things is something I didnâ€™t fully realize was so crucial to understanding my surroundings. 
                    It almost makes me appreciate the little things in my life. For example, my best friend has a dog named shadow and it brings me and my friends
                     eternal joy to see shadow happy. Petting shadow is probably the best past-time of my day, as it invokes feelings of happiness and just pure warmth and comfort.
                    I also enjoy painting, and you may be wondering how this associates wiith my sense of touch. When painting, it's almost as if you can feel the strokes
                    of the brush or the pressure of the pencil wheen it lands on paper. Little things like this provide me a comfort like no other.</p2>
