    <title>Through my senses: Smell</title>

    <h1><u><a href="selfportrait.html">The Things I Smell</a></u></h1>
    <p1> Coming from a South Asian background and living in one of the most diverse cities in the country, my sense of 
        smell can tease me. At home, I have the indulgence of traditional South Indian food. However, once I step outside into Manhattan,
         my entire perspective changes. Walking around the city and smelling the scents of the foods that street vendors are preparing and 
         smelling the aromas that are coming from different restaurants, itâ€™s almost irresistible. My favorite part about all of this? 
         Being able to smell the sweetness that invites you inside of bakeries, giving you that warm and comfy feeling.
